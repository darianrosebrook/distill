  "teacher_text": "Here are summaries of the top 3 search results for \"Python decorators\":\n\n## 1. **Official Python Documentation (docs.python.org)**\nThe authoritative reference explains decorators as functions that modify other functions/methods/classes without changing their source code. Key points:\n- **Core concept**: Decorators are \"syntactic sugar\" for higher-order functions that take a callable and return a callable\n- **Basic syntax**: The `@decorator` syntax is shorthand for `function = decorator(function)`\n- **Essential tools**: Emphasizes `functools.wraps` to preserve metadata (name, docstring) of decorated functions\n- **Types covered**: Function decorators, class decorators, and built-in decorators like `@property`, `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`\n- **Advanced usage**: Briefly mentions descriptor protocol and how decorators interact with it\n\n## 2. **Real Python Tutorial**\nAn in-depth guide focused on practical understanding and real-world applications:\n- **Foundation**: Starts with first-class functions, nested functions, and closures to build intuitive understanding\n- **Step-by-step progression**: Shows manual decoration first, then introduces `@` syntax\n- **Common patterns**: Provides reusable recipes for timing functions, logging, caching (`@lru_cache`), authentication, and retry mechanisms\n- **Advanced topics**: Detailed coverage of decorators with arguments, stacking multiple decorators, and class decorators\n- **Best practices**: Strong emphasis on using `@functools.wraps` and writing decorators that handle arguments generically (`*args, **kwargs`)\n\n## 3. **GeeksforGeeks Python Decorators**\nA beginner-friendly tutorial with clear examples and visual explanations:\n- **Simple introduction**: Uses basic examples like creating a \"hello\" decorator that adds greeting functionality\n- **Visual approach**: Often includes step-by-step execution flow diagrams\n- **Core patterns**: Covers function decorators, decorators with parameters, and chaining multiple decorators\n- **Common use cases**: Shows practical examples like access control, timing execution, and memoization\n- **Quick reference**: Provides concise code snippets that are easy to copy and experiment with",
