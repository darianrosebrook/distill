  "teacher_text": "The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized rules (protocols). Here's how it works, from the physical cables to the webpages you see:\n\n## **1. The Big Picture: A \"Network of Networks\"**\nNo single entity owns the internet. It's a decentralized collection of smaller networks (yours, your ISP's, big companies, etc.) that all agree to connect together using the same protocols\u2014primarily **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Core Concepts**\n\n### **Packet Switching**\nWhen you send data (like an email), it's broken into small **packets**. Each packet travels independently across the network, potentially taking different routes, and gets reassembled at the destination. This is efficient and resilient\u2014like sending a book chapter-by-chapter through different mail carriers.\n\n### **Protocols: The Rules of Communication**\n- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Gives every device a unique address (like a phone number) so data knows where to go. Current standard is IPv4 (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) and IPv6 for more addresses.\n- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures reliable delivery. It establishes connections, checks for errors, and guarantees packets arrive in order. If a packet is lost, it's retransmitted.\n\n### **Addressing: Finding Devices**\n- **IP Addresses**: Numerical labels for devices. Your router gets one from your ISP, which got a block from a regional authority.\n- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: The internet's \"phonebook.\" It translates human-friendly names like `google.com` into IP addresses. When you type a URL, your computer asks DNS servers to resolve it.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Physical Infrastructure**\n\n1. **Last Mile**: Your device connects to a router via Wi-Fi/Ethernet, which connects to your **ISP** (Internet Service Provider) via fiber, cable, DSL, or satellite.\n2. **ISP Network**: Your ISP's cables and routers direct your traffic locally and to larger networks.\n3. **Backbone**: High-capacity fiber-optic cables (undersea and land) form the internet's \"backbone,\" run by Tier 1 providers (e.g., AT&T, Verizon).\n4. **Data Centers**: Massive buildings housing servers that store websites, videos, and cloud services. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft operate these.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Step-by-Step: Loading a Website**\n\n1. **You type `example.com`** \u2192 Your browser asks a DNS server for the IP address.\n2. **DNS responds** with the server's IP (e.g., `93.184.216.34`).\n3. **TCP handshake**: Your computer and the server establish a connection.\n4. **HTTP/HTTPS request**: Your browser sends a request packet: \"GET the homepage.\"\n5. **Routing**: Routers along the way read the IP address and forward the packet toward the destination using routing tables\u2014the \"post offices\" of the internet.\n6. **Server responds**: The server sends back packets containing the webpage data.\n7. **Reassembly**: Your computer's TCP layer reassembles the packets and displays the page.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Key Takeaways**\n- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure; if one path breaks, data reroutes.\n- **Layered**: Physical cables, addressing, reliability, and applications work in independent layers.\n- **Open Standards**: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP are public protocols anyone can use, enabling universal compatibility.\n\nThe internet is essentially a self-organizing, global mail",
