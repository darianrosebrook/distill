  "teacher_text": "A database index is a data structure that speeds up data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage and slower writes. Think of it like the index in the back of a textbook:\n\n### The Analogy\nInstead of flipping through every page to find a topic, you check the alphabetized index, get the exact page number, and jump directly there. A database index works the same way\u2014it provides a fast lookup path to the data without scanning the entire table.\n\n### How It Works\n- **Structure**: An index is a separate, sorted data structure (typically a **B-Tree**) that stores a copy of specific column values from a table, along with pointers to the corresponding rows.\n- **Lookup**: When you query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'john@example.com'`, the database can use an index on `email` to find the row instantly rather than checking every single record (a \"full table scan\").\n\n### Key Benefits\n1. **Blazing Fast Queries**: Especially for large tables, indexes reduce lookup time from milliseconds to microseconds.\n2. **Efficient Sorting**: Speeds up `ORDER BY` operations by using the pre-sorted index.\n3. **Unique Constraints**: A unique index prevents duplicate values while also speeding lookups.\n\n### The Trade-offs (Crucial!)\nIndexes aren't free\u2014you pay for them in three ways:\n\n1. **Storage**: Indexes can consume significant disk space (sometimes as much as the table itself).\n2. **Slower Writes**: Every `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` must also update the index, adding overhead.\n3. **Complexity**: The query planner may choose the wrong index, or too many indexes can hurt performance.\n\n### When to Use Indexes\n- Columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` clauses\n- Foreign key columns\n- High-cardinality columns (many unique values, like email addresses)\n\n### When NOT to Use Indexes\n- Small tables (full scans are already fast)\n- Low-cardinality columns (like boolean flags or \"status\" with few values)\n- Frequently updated tables (the write penalty adds up)\n- Columns rarely queried\n\n### Common Types\n- **B-Tree**: The default; excellent for range queries (`<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`)\n- **Hash**: For exact equality matches only (`=`)\n- **Composite**: Index on multiple columns together (`last_name, first_name`)\n\n**Bottom line**: Indexes are essential for performance, but they're a strategic tool\u2014not a magic \"speed up everything\" button. Add them thoughtfully based on your actual query patterns.",
