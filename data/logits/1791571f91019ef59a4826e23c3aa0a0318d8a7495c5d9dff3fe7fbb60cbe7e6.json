  "prompt": "How does encryption work?",
  "teacher_text": "Encryption is the process of converting readable information (plaintext) into scrambled, unreadable data (ciphertext) using a mathematical algorithm and a secret key. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt it back to plaintext.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works, from basic principles to modern practice:\n\n---\n\n### **Core Components**\n- **Plaintext**: The original readable data\n- **Encryption Algorithm**: A mathematical formula that scrambles data\n- **Key**: A secret string of bits that controls the encryption\n- **Ciphertext**: The scrambled output\n- **Decryption**: The reverse process that uses a key to restore plaintext\n\nThe security relies on **Kerckhoffs's principle**: The algorithm can be public; only the key must be secret.\n\n---\n\n### **Two Main Types of Encryption**\n\n#### **1. Symmetric Encryption (Private-Key)**\nThe same key encrypts and decrypts data.\n\n**Simple Example: Caesar Cipher**  \nShift each letter by a fixed number (key=3):\n- `HELLO` \u2192 `KHOOR`\n- Decrypt by shifting back 3\n\n**Modern Example: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**  \nAES uses a complex process of:\n- **Substitution**: Replacing bytes with different values\n- **Permutation**: Shuffling bits around\n- **Multiple Rounds**: Repeating this process 10-14 times depending on key size\n\n**Pros**: Extremely fast, efficient for large data  \n**Cons**: **Key distribution problem**\u2014how do you securely share the key with the recipient?\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Asymmetric Encryption (Public-Key)**\nUses two mathematically linked keys:\n- **Public Key**: Anyone can see it; used to *encrypt*\n- **Private Key**: Only you know it; used to *decrypt*\n\n**Analogy**: A mailbox\n- **Public key** = Your address (anyone can find it and drop mail in)\n- **Private key** = Your physical key (only you can open and read mail)\n\n**How RSA Works (Conceptually)**:\nBased on the fact that multiplying two large prime numbers is easy, but factoring their product is nearly impossible.\n\n1. You generate two huge primes and multiply them (public key component)\n2. The private key contains the original primes\n3. Encryption uses the public key (the product)\n4. Decryption requires the private key (the factors)\n\n**Pros**: Solves key distribution\u2014no need to secretly share keys  \n**Cons**: 100-1000x slower than symmetric encryption; only practical for small data\n\n---\n\n### **The Hybrid Solution (How the Internet Works)**\n\nSince asymmetric is too slow for large files, we combine both:\n\n1. **Your browser** generates a random symmetric key (session key)\n2. **Encrypts it**",
