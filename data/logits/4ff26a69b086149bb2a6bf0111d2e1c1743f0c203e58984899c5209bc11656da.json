  "teacher_text": "A CPU executes instructions through a continuous cycle called the **Fetch-Decode-Execute** cycle. Think of it as the CPU's heartbeat, synchronized by an internal clock. Here\u2019s how it works at a high level:\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Core Components Involved**\nBefore diving into the cycle, you need to know the key players:\n- **Control Unit (CU):** The \"orchestrator\" that directs all operations.\n- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs mathematical and logical calculations.\n- **Registers:** Ultra-fast, tiny storage locations inside the CPU. Key ones include:\n  - **Program Counter (PC):** Holds the memory address of the *next* instruction.\n  - **Instruction Register (IR):** Holds the *current* instruction being executed.\n  - **General-Purpose Registers:** Hold data being worked on.\n- **Cache:** High-speed memory that stores frequently used instructions and data.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle**\n\n#### **Step 1: Fetch**\nThe CPU retrieves the next instruction from memory.\n- The Control Unit looks at the **Program Counter (PC)** to get the memory address of the next instruction.\n- It fetches the instruction (a binary number) from that address in RAM (or cache) and loads it into the **Instruction Register (IR)**.\n- The PC is then incremented to point to the *following* instruction.\n\n#### **Step 2: Decode**\nThe CPU figures out what the instruction means.\n- The Control Unit breaks down the binary instruction into two parts: the **opcode** (what operation to perform, e.g., ADD, MOVE) and the **operands** (what data to operate on, e.g., registers, memory addresses).\n- It checks the **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**\u2014the CPU's built-in \"dictionary\"\u2014to interpret the instruction.\n\n#### **Step 3: Execute**\nThe CPU performs the actual operation.\n- If it's a math/logic instruction (e.g., ADD), the ALU performs the calculation using data from registers.\n- If it's a memory instruction (e.g., LOAD), data is moved between registers and memory.\n- If it's a control instruction (e.g., JUMP), the PC is updated to a new address.\n\n#### **Step 4: Store (Writeback)**\nThe result is written back to a register or memory, making",
