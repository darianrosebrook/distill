  "teacher_text": "I don't have real-time internet access to perform a live search, but based on commonly referenced authoritative sources about Python decorators, here are summaries of what would typically be the top 3 results:\n\n### 1. **Official Python Documentation (docs.python.org)**\nThe official docs define decorators as functions that modify the functionality of another function or method. They explain that decorators are executed at import time and provide the fundamental syntax: `@decorator` placed before a function definition. Key points include how decorators wrap functions, the importance of `functools.wraps` to preserve metadata, and examples of simple decorators that add behavior before/after the decorated function runs. The docs emphasize that decorators are just syntactic sugar for `func = decorator(func)`.\n\n### 2. **Real Python Tutorial (realpython.com)**\nThis practical guide focuses on real-world applications and progressive learning. It covers function decorators in depth with examples like timing functions, debugging, authentication, and retry mechanisms. It also explains class decorators, property decorators (`@property`, `@setter`), and decorator factories (decorators that accept arguments). The tutorial emphasizes the decorator pattern's power for code reuse and separation of concerns, with clear before/after code comparisons.\n\n### 3. **PEP 318 \u2013 Decorators for Functions and Methods**\nThis original 2003 proposal document explains the rationale behind introducing decorator syntax to Python. It discusses the problems decorators solve (reducing boilerplate and improving readability compared to manual function wrapping), the design decisions (why `@` symbol was chosen), and the community debate around implementation. It provides historical context and shows how the syntax made common patterns in frameworks like Zope and Python's own `staticmethod`/`classmethod` more elegant and Pythonic.\n\n---\n\n**Core Concept Summary**: Decorators are a powerful metaprogramming tool that let you extend or modify function/method behavior without changing their source code, enabling cleaner, more maintainable, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Python code.",
