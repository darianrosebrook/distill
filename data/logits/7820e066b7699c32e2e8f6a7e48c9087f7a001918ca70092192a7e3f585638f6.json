  "teacher_text": "The main causes of climate change, ranked by their contribution to current global warming, are:\n\n### **1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Primary Driver)**\nHuman activities have dramatically increased greenhouse gases, enhancing the natural greenhouse effect:\n- **Carbon Dioxide (CO\u2082)**: Accounts for about 75% of human-caused emissions. Main sources are burning **fossil fuels** (coal, oil, natural gas) for electricity, heat, and transportation; **deforestation**; and industrial processes like cement production.\n- **Methane (CH\u2084)**: From agriculture (livestock, rice cultivation), fossil fuel production, and waste landfills. It's 25x more potent than CO\u2082 but shorter-lived.\n- **Nitrous Oxide (N\u2082O)**: From synthetic fertilizers, manure, and industrial activities.\n- **Fluorinated Gases**: Synthetic gases used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and manufacturing with extremely high warming potential.\n\n### **2. Other Human Activities**\n- **Deforestation & Land Use Changes**: Reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO\u2082 and releases stored carbon.\n- **Aerosol Pollution**: Some particles (like sulfates) have a slight cooling effect, while others (like black carbon) warm the atmosphere. Net effect is smaller than greenhouse gases.\n\n### **3. Natural Factors (Minimal Recent Impact)**\nWhile natural processes have historically",
