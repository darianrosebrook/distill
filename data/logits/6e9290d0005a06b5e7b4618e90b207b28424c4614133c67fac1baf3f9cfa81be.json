  "prompt": "How do search engines rank web pages?",
  "teacher_text": "Search engines like Google use a complex, multi-step process to rank web pages. While the exact algorithms are secret and constantly evolving, here\u2019s how the system generally works:\n\n### **1. Crawling & Indexing (The Foundation)**\nBefore ranking, search engines must discover and store pages:\n- **Crawling:** Bots (spiders) follow links across the web to find new and updated pages.\n- **Indexing:** Analyzed content is stored in a massive database. Not every crawled page gets indexed\u2014quality filters apply.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Ranking Process (When You Search)**\n\nWhen you enter a query, the search engine does three things instantly:\n\n**A. Understanding Intent**\n- Interprets your query (informational, navigational, transactional, local)\n- Expands synonyms & corrects typos (\"best pizza near me\" \u2192 local restaurants)\n\n**B. Filtering & Retrieval**\n- Pulls all potentially relevant pages from the index (millions of candidates)\n\n**C. Ranking (The \"Secret Sauce\")**\n- Applies hundreds of ranking factors to sort results by perceived usefulness\n\n---\n\n### **3. Key Ranking Factors**\n\nThese are the core signals that determine order:\n\n| Category | Key Elements |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Relevance** | - Keyword usage in titles, headings, body<br>- Search intent match (does content answer the query?)<br>- Topical depth & comprehensiveness |\n| **Authority** | - **Backlinks:** Quality & quantity of links from other sites (like votes of confidence)<br>- **E-E-A-T:** Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness (especially for YMYL topics) |\n| **User Experience** | - **Core Web Vitals:** Loading speed, interactivity, visual stability<br>- Mobile-friendliness<br>- Secure HTTPS connection<br>- Intrusive ads penalty |\n| **Technical SEO** | - Clean site structure & internal linking<br>- Proper meta tags & schema markup<br>- No crawl errors or duplicate content |\n| **Freshness** | - Newer content often ranks higher for time-sensitive queries |\n| **User Signals** | - Click-through rate (CTR)<br>- Dwell time & bounce rate (debated as direct factors, but correlate with quality) |\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Role of AI & Machine Learning**\n\nModern search uses AI to better understand language and behavior:\n- **RankBrain:** Helps interpret never-before-seen queries\n- **BERT:** Understands context and nuance in natural language\n- **MUM:** Multitask AI for complex query understanding across languages/media\n\n---\n\n### **5. Personalization & Context**\n\nResults are tailored based on:\n- **Location** (country, city)\n- **Search history**\n- **Device type** (mobile vs. desktop)\n- **Language preferences**\n\n---\n\n### **6. Constant Evolution**\n\n- **Algorithm Updates:** Google makes thousands of changes yearly (major ones like \"Helpful Content Update\" target specific issues)\n- **Testing:** Results are continuously A/B tested using human quality raters\n\n### **Bottom Line**\nRanking is a holistic score",
