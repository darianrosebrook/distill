  "teacher_text": "The primary difference between **HTTP** and **HTTPS** is security:\n\n- **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) sends data as plain text\n- **HTTPS** (HyperText Transfer Protocol **Secure**) encrypts data during transmission\n\n---\n\n## Key Differences at a Glance\n\n| Feature | HTTP | HTTPS |\n|---------|------|-------|\n| **Security** | Unencrypted, vulnerable to eavesdropping | Encrypted with SSL/TLS |\n| **Port** | 80 | 443 |\n| **Browser Indicator** | \"Not secure\" warning | Padlock icon \ud83d\udd12 |\n| **Data Integrity** | Can be modified in transit | Cannot be altered undetected |\n| **Authentication** | No server identity verification | Verifies website identity |\n\n---\n\n## How HTTPS Works\n\nHTTPS uses **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)** to create a secure connection:\n\n1. **Encryption**: Scrambles data so only the sender and intended recipient can read it\n2. **Authentication**: Uses digital certificates to verify you are connected to the real website\n3. **Integrity**: Prevents data from being tampered with during transmission\n\nWhen you connect to an HTTPS site:\n- Your browser and server perform a \"handshake\" to establish encryption\n- The server presents an SSL certificate (issued by a trusted Certificate Authority)\n- A unique session key is created for encrypting your data\n\n---\n\n## Why It Matters\n\n**HTTP risks:**\n- Passwords and credit cards can be stolen\n- Content can be spied on or altered\n- Man-in-the-middle attacks\n- ISP or others can inject ads or malware\n\n**HTTPS benefits:**\n- \u2705 Protects sensitive information\n- \u2705 Prevents tampering and eavesdropping\n- \u2705 **SEO boost** (Google ranks HTTPS sites higher)\n- \u2705 Required for modern features (geolocation, camera access, PWA)\n- \u2705 Builds user trust\n\n---\n\n## Modern Reality\n\n- **HTTPS is now the standard** for all websites, not just e-commerce\n- Free certificates are available through [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)\n- Performance is no longer an issue (HTTPS is required for HTTP/2, which is faster)\n- Browsers now actively warn users away from HTTP sites\n\n**Bottom line**: Always use HTTPS for any website. There's no good reason to use HTTP in 2024.",
