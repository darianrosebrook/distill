  "prompt": "What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?",
  "teacher_text": "The key difference is that **deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning**. Think of it as a nesting doll: Artificial Intelligence (AI) encompasses Machine Learning (ML), which in turn encompasses Deep Learning (DL). While both enable computers to learn from data, they differ in approach, requirements, and typical applications.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the main distinctions:\n\n**1. Feature Engineering: Manual vs. Automatic**\n- **Machine Learning**: Requires a human expert to manually identify and extract relevant features from raw data. For example, to classify images of cats and dogs, you\u2019d manually program features like edge detectors, color histograms, or textures. The algorithm learns from these *pre-defined* features.\n- **Deep Learning**: Automatically discovers the relevant features directly from raw data. A deep neural network fed raw pixel values will learn its own hierarchical features\u2014first edges, then shapes, then ears or whiskles\u2014without explicit human instruction. This is its most defining characteristic.\n\n**2. Data Requirements: Big vs. Bigger**\n- **Machine Learning**: Can perform well on relatively small datasets (thousands of points). Models like decision trees or logistic regression don\u2019t need massive amounts of data to find patterns.\n- **Deep Learning**: Thrives on massive datasets (millions of points). Its complex architectures require enormous amounts of labeled data to avoid overfitting and learn robust features. With small data, it often performs worse than traditional ML.\n\n**3. Computational Power: Light vs. Heavy**\n- **Machine Learning**: Most models can be trained efficiently on a standard CPU. They are computationally lightweight.\n- **Deep Learning**: Requires significant computational resources, typically **GPUs** (Graphics Processing Units), to handle the matrix operations of large neural networks. Training can take days or weeks on specialized hardware.\n\n**4. Model Complexity & Architecture**\n- **Machine Learning**: Uses a variety of algorithms\u2014linear regression, SVMs, random forests\u2014most of which are structurally simpler and have fewer parameters.\n",
