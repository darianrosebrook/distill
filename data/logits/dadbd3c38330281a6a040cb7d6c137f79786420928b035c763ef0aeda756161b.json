  "teacher_text": "Here is a clear breakdown of the key differences between a process and a thread:\n\n---\n\n### **Core Definitions**\n\n*   **Process**: An independent program in execution. It is the basic unit of resource allocation and isolation in an operating system. Each process has its own separate memory space, system resources, and execution state.\n*   **Thread**: The smallest unit of execution *within* a process. A thread is a lightweight, sequential flow of control that shares the process's resources (memory, files, etc.) but has its own execution context (stack, registers, program counter).\n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences**\n\n| Feature | Process | Thread |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Memory & Resources** | **Isolated**. Each process has its own independent address space, code, data, heap, and file handles. | **Shared**. Threads within the same process share the address space, code, data, heap, and files. Each thread has its own stack and registers. |\n| **Overhead** | **Heavyweight**. Creating, destroying, and switching processes is slow and resource-intensive. | **Lightweight**. Creating, destroying, and switching threads is much faster and requires fewer resources. |\n| **Communication** | **Complex**. Must use Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms like pipes, sockets, or shared memory (which is harder to set up). | **Simple and Fast**. Can directly read",
