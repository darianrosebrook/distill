  "teacher_text": "The solutions to the quadratic equation x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = 0 are **x = -2** and **x = -3**.\n\n**Here's the solution using factoring:**\n\n1.  Factor the quadratic expression by finding two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3.\n    x\u00b2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0\n\n2.  Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n    *   x + 2 = 0  =>  **x = -2**\n    *   x + 3 = 0  =>  **x = -3**\n\n**Verification:**\n*   For x = -2: (-2)\u00b2 + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0\n*   For x = -3: (-3)\u00b2 + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0\n\nBoth solutions satisfy the equation.",
