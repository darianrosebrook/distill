  "teacher_text": "## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Programming\n\n### **Core Concept**\n\n**Synchronous** means \"happening at the same time\" \u2014 tasks execute **sequentially**, one after another. Each task must complete before the next one starts.\n\n**Asynchronous** means \"not happening at the same time\" \u2014 tasks can start and run **concurrently** without waiting for previous tasks to finish.\n\n---\n\n### **Synchronous Programming (Blocking)**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Code executes line by line\n- Each operation **blocks** the execution until it completes\n- The program waits idle during time-consuming tasks (I/O, network requests)\n\n**Real-world analogy:** Waiting in line at a coffee shop where you order, wait at the counter blocking the next person until your drink is ready.\n\n```javascript\n// SYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE\nfunction makeCoffee() {\n  console.log(\"Start making coffee...\");\n  const start = Date.now();\n  while (Date.now() - start < 3000) {} // Blocks for 3 seconds\n  console.log(\"Coffee ready!\");\n}\n\nfunction payBill() {\n  console.log(\"Paying bill...\");\n}\n\nmakeCoffee();  // Must finish before next line\npayBill();     // Waits 3 seconds\n\n// Output:\n// Start making coffee...\n// Coffee ready! (after 3 seconds)\n// Paying bill...\n```\n\n**Pros:**\n- Simpler to write and debug\n- Predictable execution order\n- No race conditions\n\n**Cons:**\n- Wastes CPU time waiting\n- Unresponsive UI during long tasks\n- Inefficient resource utilization\n\n---\n\n### **Asynchronous Programming (Non-blocking)**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Tasks start and **immediately return** control to the program\n- The program continues executing other code\n- Tasks complete \"in the background\" and notify the main thread when done\n- Common patterns: callbacks, Promises, async/await\n\n**Real-world analogy:** Ordering coffee with a pager. You order, get a buzzer, step aside so others can order. The buzzer notifies you when your drink is ready while",
