  "teacher_text": "Photosynthesis is the biological process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy\u2014typically from the sun\u2014into chemical energy stored in glucose (sugar). This process occurs in chloroplasts, primarily in the leaves of plants, and is essential for most life on Earth, producing both food and oxygen. It can be summarized by the overall equation:\n\n**6CO\u2082 + 6H\u2082O + light energy \u2192 C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 + 6O\u2082**\n\nThe process is divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).\n\n---\n\n### **Stage 1: Light-Dependent Reactions**\n*Location:* Thylakoid membranes within the chloroplasts.\n\nThese reactions capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.\n\n1. **Light Absorption:** Chlorophyll and other pigments in Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI) absorb photons of light, exciting electrons to a higher energy state.\n2. **Water Splitting (Photolysis):** In PSII, the energy is used to split water molecules (H\u2082O) into oxygen (O\u2082), protons (H\u207a), and",
