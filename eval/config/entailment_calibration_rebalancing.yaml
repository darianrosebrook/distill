# Entailment Calibration Dataset Rebalancing Plan
# Target: Information-theoretic optimal balance for high-calibration, bias-resistant verifier

target_distribution:
  total_examples: 400
  support: 25-30%  # 100-120 examples
  contradict: 25-30%  # 100-120 examples
  insufficient_hard: 25%  # 100 examples (verifiable but missing key info)
  insufficient_vague: 15-20%  # 60-80 examples (non-verifiable/subjective)

current_state:
  total: 354
  support: 70 (19.8%)
  contradict: 73 (20.6%)
  insufficient_hard: 74 (20.9%)
  insufficient_vague: 137 (38.7%)

new_example_categories:
  hard_insufficient:
    - time_mismatch: "Evidence from different time period than claim"
    - domain_shift: "Evidence from different domain/context than claim"
    - missing_numerics: "Evidence mentions improvement but lacks specific numbers"
    - partial_coverage: "Evidence covers part of claim but not all elements"
    - version_mismatch: "Evidence from different version than claim"
    
  contrastive_pairs:
    - vague_triplet: "For each vague example, add support+contradict with same claim"
    - quantitative_gradient: "Vary precision: 'reduced' → 'reduced by 10ms' → 'reduced from 500ms to 490ms'"
    
  linguistic_diversity:
    - epistemic_verbs: "suggests, implies, indicates" (max 10-12% each)
    - source_cues: "user report, press release, speculation" (max 10-12% each)
    - temporal_hedging: "so far, so far appears to be" (max 10-12% each)
    - confidence_markers: "highly likely, possibly, roughly" (max 10-12% each)

quality_metrics_to_track:
  - expected_calibration_error: "Target < 0.1 on held-out factual examples"
  - false_insufficient_rate: "Target < 15% on near-verifiable claims"
  - semantic_separation_index: "Target > 0.3 cosine distance between support↔insufficient vs contradict↔insufficient"
  - lexical_entropy: "Target > 3.0 bits for insufficient cluster (heterogeneity, not redundancy)"
