# Process Discipline

## Servers

- Before starting a dev server, check if one is already running on the port; reuse or stop it to avoid duplicates.
- If multiple processes are attached to the port, list and kill explicitly; document PIDs in the PR note if non-obvious.

## Hung/Canceled Commands

If a command is canceled or stalls:

1. Assume it hung or waited for input.
2. Re-run with verbose/debug flags.
3. Surface the prompt/interaction in the PR so reviewers understand the resolution.
