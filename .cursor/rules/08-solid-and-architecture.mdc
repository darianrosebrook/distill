# Architecture Invariants

- SRP: Each module/class has one reason to change.
- OCP: Prefer extension points over editing stable internals.
- LSP/ISP/DIP: Respect substitution; segregate interfaces; depend on abstractions.

## Change Isolation

- Introduce seams (interfaces/strategies) near integration points.
- Add tests at seams; assert unchanged public behavior.
