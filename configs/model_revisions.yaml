# configs/model_revisions.yaml
# Model revision pinning configuration for supply chain security
# @author: @darianrosebrook
#
# This file maps Hugging Face model identifiers to specific revisions (commit SHAs, tags, or branches).
# For production models, pin to specific commit SHAs for maximum security.
# For development, can use tags or branch names.
#
# Usage:
#   - Production: Use commit SHA (e.g., "abc123def456...")
#   - Development: Use tag (e.g., "v1.0.0") or branch (e.g., "main")
#   - Default: If model not listed, defaults to "main" branch with warning

model_revisions:
  # Production models - pin to specific commit SHA
  # Example (uncomment and update with actual commit SHA):
  # "microsoft/deberta-v3-small":
  #   revision: "abc123def4567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12"
  #   trust_remote_code: false
  #   notes: "Production judge model - pinned for security"

  # Development models - can use tags or branches
  # Example:
  # "bert-base-uncased":
  #   revision: "v1.0.0"
  #   trust_remote_code: false
  #   notes: "Development model - using tag"

  # Default fallback configuration
  default:
    revision: "main"
    trust_remote_code: false
    notes: "Default fallback - models not in this config will use 'main' branch"

# Instructions for adding new models:
#
# 1. Find the model on Hugging Face Hub
# 2. Navigate to the model's commit history
# 3. Copy the commit SHA of the version you want to pin
# 4. Add entry to model_revisions section above
# 5. Update training/safe_model_loading.py to load from this config
#
# Example:
#   "organization/model-name":
#     revision: "commit_sha_here"
#     trust_remote_code: false
#     notes: "Description of model usage"
